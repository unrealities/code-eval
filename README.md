These are solutions (currently mostly in Ruby) for challenges posted at codeeval.com

This is meant for my own personal use, but obviously anyone is more than welcome to look at my solutions for inspiration. Or even better to suggest better alternate solutions, or more idiomatic solutions.


For submitting Java solutions: remove package line and change class and constructor calls to 'Main'
