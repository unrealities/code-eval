#SWAP ELEMENTS
##CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION:

You are given a list of numbers which is supplemented with positions that have to be swapped.

##INPUT SAMPLE:

Your program should accept as its first argument a path to a filename. Input example is the following

>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 : 0-8

>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 : 0-1, 1-3

As you can see a colon separates numbers with positions. 
Positions start with 0. 
You have to process positions left to right. In the example above (2nd line) first you process 0-1, then 1-3.

##OUTPUT SAMPLE:

Print the lists in the following way.

>9 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1

>2 4 3 1 5 6 7 8 9 10
