# 73 - DECODE NUMBERS
## CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION:

You are given an encoded message containing only numbers. You are also provided with the following mapping:

A : 1
B : 2
C : 3
...
Z : 26
Given an encoded message, count the number of ways it can be decoded.

## INPUT SAMPLE:

Your program should accept as its first argument a path to a filename. Each line in this file is a test-case and contains an encoded message of numbers. E.g.

> 12

> 123

You may assume that the test cases contain only numbers.

## OUTPUT SAMPLE:

Print out the different number of ways it can be decoded. E.g.

> 2

> 3

NOTE: 12 could be decoded as AB(1 2) or L(12). Hence the number of ways to decode 12 is 2.
